# nibefighter

Project for data collection, analytics and optimization for Nibe Fighter heat pumps. 

Initial ideas with the project are:

  1. Get graphs and visualization for your heat pump without paying +1K Euros for an RCU-11 unit from Nibe.
  2. Optimize the heat pump oeration by the use of machine learning. This as the Nibe heat curve functionality is static and  basic in comparison with a trained machine learning scenario. Goal is decrease power consumption by 5% with same comfort. 
  
Can be used as a replacement for the Nibe RCU-10 or RCU-11 commercial modules.  

The project should work with the listed pumps below (list is based on pumps compatible with RCU-11/10):

  Nibe Fighter 360p (*)
  Nibe Fighter 113x (*)
  Nibe Fighter 1150 (*)
  Nibe Fighter 123x
  Nibe Fighter 1250
  Nibe Fighter 1320
  Nibe Fighter 1330

(* = verified - Please add your model to the list of verified heat pumps)

Current functionality: 

  - Data collection over RS485 serial bus
  - Posting of data to HTTP REST service over Wifi using ESPN8266
  - Currently configured for logstash HTTP Input module (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-inputs-http.html)
 Â 
In the Roadmap:

  - Elasticsearch Dashboard for visualization (in progress).
  - Usage of AI / Machine learning for heat pump optimization and  management.
  - Figure out and implement the Nibe Command structure so pump can be managed prgrammatically.
   

Requirements:

 - Arduino ATmega2560 (or any Arduino compatible board with support for two or more programmable serial ports).
 - ESP2866 Wifi shield for Arduino
 - WifiEsp Software library for ESP8266 - https://github.com/bportaluri/WiFiEsp
 - RS485 shield for Arduino
 
 - A compatibel Nibe Fighter heat pump running Nibe Software version 2.0 or above (required for RCU-10/11 functionality)
 - A webservice collecting the Nibe data messages (logstash, hadoop, nodejs etc, etc)
